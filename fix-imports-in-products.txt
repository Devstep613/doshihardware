Correct import statements to use in src/pages/Products.tsx:

import Navbar from "@/components/Navbar";
import Footer from "@/components/Footer";
import waterTanksImg from "@/assets/products/water-tanks.jpg";
import cementImg from "@/assets/products/cement.jpeg";
import roofingImg from "@/assets/products/roofing.jpg";

Make sure to replace any import lines importing images or components with the lines above, including no extra quotes inside the strings.

After editing, save the file and restart your Vite development server to clear any cached import errors.
